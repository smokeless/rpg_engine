# rpg_engine
An rpg engine from the ground up using pygame. It's in alpha stages. Can use sprite sheets etc. Project is likely to be scrapped due to the availability of more batteries included type systems like cocos2dx


# Quick About:
I started writing this because pygame handles basic things (blit, sound, font rendering), but it's only the components to
make an engine. This is the start of an engine. There's a scene manager, input handling, the ability to render text to windows,
player, and player movement. I've decided to move to Cocos2d-x for a better approach. Though I may finish this project in the future.
